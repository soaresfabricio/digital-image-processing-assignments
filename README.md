## What is Digital Image Processing?
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_processing)

> In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of multidimensional systems.

## Assignment #1

For each of the following operations, receive an image file as input and process it to generate the appropriate output:

1. RGB <=> YIQ conversion
2. Separation of color bands
3. Negative of an image
4. Additive brightness control 
5. Multiplicative brightness control
6. Thresholding
7. Mean (box) filter and median filter
8. Edge detection (Sobel operator)
9. Mask operations (for arbitrary mask sizes)
